# CS284A Fall 2023: Using LSTM to predict sleeping states
Contains code for 284A final project.
Data is provided by the Child Mind Institute hosted on Kaggle and can be found at the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-detect-sleep-states/data
If you want to run the code, please download the data and change the import destinations to where the data actually is. Due to file size constraints, this repository does not contain pre-trained models or the datafiles themselves.

TO RUN CODE:
Contained in this repository is a jupyter notebook. Please run this chronoloically (i.e. run blocks in order from top to bottom). Note that data processing can take a long time, and training the LSTM can take longer.
